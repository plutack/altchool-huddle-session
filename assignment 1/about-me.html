    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Talut Akorede Salako, and I hold the Altschool student ID
      <b>ALT/SOE/023/2630</b>. I'm the third child in a family of six, including
      my parents. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I
      have a deep passion for technology, and I often immerse myself in
      tech-related content, both in video and written formats, for both leisure
      and learning purposes.

    <h2>Journey so far</h2>
    <p>
      As the popular saying goes,<q
        ><b>a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step</b></q
      >
      . For me, that step was taken quite some time ago when I watched my first
      live HTML coding session. It was during that moment when I realized that
      programming was something I was genuinely interested in, and as it turned
      out, I was not mistaken. One of the significant steps I've taken on this
      journey is registering for the Altschool School of Engineering program,
      which is set to last for 12 months.

    <h2>What i hope to achieve</h2>
    <p>
      This program is something I'm taking very seriously, giving it my full
      200% effort. I might be exaggerating a bit, but regardless, I have high
      hopes for myself by the end of this program. With consistent hard work and
      dedication, I aim to secure a junior role in one of the renowned FAANG
      companies. Yes, I said it! &#128516;
